### $ whoami

- 👋 I am Sen Lin, aka [@posoo](https://github.com/posoo), a rookie Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Northwestern Univeristy.

- 🐣 I have been working on a wide variety of projects from edge to cloud, at a hello-world level.

- 🥷 Currently, I am dedicating myself to Compuetr Network research, that network has no relation to the AI world (_which I believe it's worthwhile to mention nowadays. 🤡 But I sometimes may play with the neural networks. Hence I have a network of networks installed in my brain 🧠_)

- 🏠 Now, I am based in Chicago area, accurately, jailed in my apartment due to the COVID pandemic.
