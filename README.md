## $ whoami

Hi, I’m Sen Lin, aka [@posoo](https://github.com/posoo). I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Northwestern University. 
My research focuses on the **low-latency** and **cross-layer** optimization of networking systems, with an emphasis on **deployable** design under Internet constraints. I design protocols that bridge traditionally decoupled layers and build high-performance systems that preserve Internet semantics while adapting to evolving workloads.

## $ grep "opportunities" ~/career_path

I am actively seeking research and engineering roles related to **real-time systems**, **multimedia streaming**, and **data center networking**. If you’re hiring, let’s [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/senlin-posoo/)!
